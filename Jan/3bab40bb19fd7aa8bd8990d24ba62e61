#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola is celebrating the achievements of inmates who sat for the 2022 matric exams. He says it must be compulsory for prisoners younger than 35 to study so they give hope when they return to their communities. "They have performed really well with about 10.5 percent improvement from the previous year," says Lamola. "We need to encourage them to work hard and study so they can improve themselves," he adds.

However, the department provides the basic education provided by government. Lamola says the inmates are encouraged to participate in the program so that they can have a skill and education, so they do not go back to a life of crime. "This is an investment for South Africa," he says.
