  JOHANNESBURG - Obliterate that thought. That's President Cyril Ramaphosa's response to questions about when he will reshuffle his Cabinet. ANC Secretary General Fikile Mbalula told the media that conversations will start in the next two weeks. There are ministers who didn't make it into the NEC and will have to make way for new NEC members. Mbalula will vacate his position to be at the ANC’s headquarters full-time.
