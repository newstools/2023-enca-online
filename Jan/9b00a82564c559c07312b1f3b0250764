#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNNESBURG - Basic Education minister Angie Motshekga is again defending the matric pass mark. She was responding to comments by Build One SA leader Mmusi Maimane that a 30-percent pass mark undermines the intellect of SA’s youth. Motshekga says this is a myth perpetuated year after year. A basic matric pass requires a pupil to achieve at least 40-percent in three subjects, including their home language, and three other subjects with a minimum of 30-percent. Motshekga says 30-percent is not the required pass mark.
