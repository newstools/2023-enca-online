Slade was sent off for a dangerous tackle on the Bulls' South Africa full-back Kurt-Lee Arendse in a 39-28 Champions Cup defeat in Pretoria. European Professional Club Rugby announced on Wednesday that the decision had been overturned by an independent disciplinary hearing. It clears Slade to face Castres in Exeter's final Champions Cup pool game on Saturday as well as compete for a place in England's midfield for Steve Borthwick's first game in charge at Twickenham.
