The ANC Free State elective conference is in full swing after long delays. The first day was marred by disruptions by disgruntled members over the registration process. For more, eNCA speaks to political analyst, Sandile Swana. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -Â Political analyst Sandile Swana says disruptions at the ANC Free State conference shows just how deeply the party is divided. The registration of delegates was initially suspended after disgruntled members caused drama. "It shows that from 2017 until now they have not been able to create a robust membership system that identifies correctly who their members are which then also shows that the whole idea and practice of creating bogus members as well as bogus branches of the ANC in order to win elections by fraud, that idea is refusing to die in the ANC," he said. "Whatever delays you saw yesterday and today are similar to the ones you saw in Nasrec in December running into January this year. It shows that the organisation is going through a painful and demanding process of changing and becoming a credible political party in South Africa that can contest and win elections."
