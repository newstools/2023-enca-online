"Demand is too high. We're still averaging between 285 and 288 megalitres per day when the Department of Water Affairs said it should actually be nowhere more than 250 megalitres at the moment." Meanwhile, in the next two months the metro is expected to have an additional 30 megaliters of water. Director of Water and Sanitation Barry Martin says over R1 billion has been set aside to ensure the water crisis and drought can be tackled and resolved.
