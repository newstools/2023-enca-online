eNCA's Heidi Giokos spoke with Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -Â South Africa will not go to the World Economic Forum and lie to the international community about the country's challenges. That's the word from finance minister Enoch Godongwana. South Africa heads to the global meeting as it grapples with a power crisis, high unemployment and subdued economic growth. Despite this, the finance minister says the government has an action plan to deal with these issues and will be communicating this to world leaders and potential investors. Godongwana will form part of the delegation accompanying President Cyril Ramaphosa later this month. The meeting will be taking place in Davos, Switzerland. eNCA reporter Heidi Giokos spoke with the minister earlier.
