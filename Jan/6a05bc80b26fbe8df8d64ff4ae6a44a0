That’s according to park CEO Sibusiso Bukhosini. Biodiversity, natural beauty and unique ecological process make Isimangaliso, located on KwaZulu-Natal’s north coast, stand out. However, prolonged droughts and rapidly changing weather patterns pose a threat to biodiversity. Isimangaliso is home to some rare and well-protected species and marine protected areas. eNCA’s Siphamandla Goge reports. Watch the video above for more details.
