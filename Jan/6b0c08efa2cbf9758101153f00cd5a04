#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will find out if Jacob Zuma's private prosecution will go ahead on Thursday. The High Court in Johannesburg hands down judgment on his urgent application to interdict the case. Lawyers for both parties appeared before the full bench of the high court on Thursday last week. Ramaphosa wants to interdict the case from going ahead on Thursday. He says Zuma's pursuit of this infringes on his rights and affects the country. Ramaphosa says two summonses obtained by Zuma against him are unlawful as they are based on a non-prosecution certificate that does not implicate him.
