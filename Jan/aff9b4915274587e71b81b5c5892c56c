"It does seem to be currently replacing the other strains without completing them through transmissibility where it's become prevalent in the US and has been doing that for some time," Welte said. READ: Severity of new COVID-19 variant unknown "They have not seen any really major uptick in the number of deaths, they're currently seeing a small uptick in the number of deaths, this could just be because they're well into the winter. "This doesn't mean cases have a higher sort of risk of being severe once it has happened. We don't know too much about the severity, there isn't any striking signal that it's anything terribly outrageous or significant so I don't think we need to panic."
