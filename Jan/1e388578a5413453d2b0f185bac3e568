Aston Villa have signed Real Betis defender Alex Moreno LONDON - Aston Villa signed Spanish defender Alex Moreno from Real Betis for a reported Â£13 million ($15 million) on Wednesday. Moreno will move to the Premier League club subject to international clearance and a visa application. The 29-year-old left-back becomes Unai Emery's first signing since he replaced Steven Gerrard as Villa boss in November. "Alex is a good player that can help our squad. He has been one of the top left-backs in La Liga over the past few seasons and we are delighted to have him here," Emery told Villa's website. Moreno will compete with Lucas Digne for a spot in Villa's defence and can also play on the left side of midfield. He made 122 appearances for Betis, scoring six times, after moving from Rayo Vallecano.
