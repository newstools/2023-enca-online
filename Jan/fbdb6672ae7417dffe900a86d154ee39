Sharks' French assistant coach Yannick Bru BORDEAUX - Ex-France hooker Yannick Bru has signed to become manager of Bordeaux-Begles next season, club president Laurent Marti said Tuesday. Bru, 49, cut his playing teeth with Toulouse before taking up coaching, first at that club before becoming assistant to then-France coach Guy Noves. A move to Bayonne between 2018-22 has been followed by a stint as consultant with the Durban-based Sharks, who ironically take on Bordeaux-Begles in the Champions Cup on Saturday. Bru signed a four-year deal alongside Thibault Giroud, currently performance director for the France national team. rap/lp/ea
