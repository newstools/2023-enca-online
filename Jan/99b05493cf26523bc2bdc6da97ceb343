Messi had been rested for PSG's first three matches following the long break in the season caused by the World Cup but he returned to training in Paris a week ago and was back in the starting line-up for this game against Ligue 1's bottom side. The win, which came three and a half weeks after he captained Argentina to their World Cup final triumph on penalties against France in Qatar, saw PSG move six points clear at the top of the French table. Neymar also started, having missed his team's last two matches due to suspension and to undergo treatment on the ankle injury he suffered playing for Brazil at the World Cup. PSG were not at their sparkling best but Messi swept in his 13th club goal of the season to make it 2-0 with 17 minutes left. Hugo Ekitike and Nordi Mukiele were again involved before Messi applied the finish. The goal was initially disallowed for offside but a VAR check allowed it to stand. "Messi has recovered well. He is relaxed and in great shape physically, and with Leo the team looks different," said coach Christophe Galtier. Speaking to broadcaster Canal Plus, Galtier, who said he had come down with a fever during the game, added: "We are coming back off the World Cup so it is difficult for the players to find their reference points again." "We are all just getting used to playing together again and you could see at times that we lacked some of the connections between the players that we had more often before the World Cup."
