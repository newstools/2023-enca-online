AFP/Guillem Sartorio JOHANNESBURG - There's no room for those opposing the ANC's renewal process. That's the message from ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa. He says the party has put divisions and factions behind it. Ramaphosa says these have contributed to the decline of the party. He was addressing the Gala Dinner ahead of the party's January 8 Statement. "The delegates that were present at the conference resolved as one to put behind us the harmful organizational practices and tendencies that have contributed to the decline of the movement in recent years. They stood firm to renew and to unite our organization and in fact there is no longer any room left for those who are opposed to the renewal process. No room at all. It’s no longer left for seeds of division in the African national congress,” Ramaphosa said.
