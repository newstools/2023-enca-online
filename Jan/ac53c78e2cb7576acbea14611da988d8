Farm workers bore the brunt of the sweltering temperatures, exacerbated by the ongoing blackouts. According to Northern Cape MEC for Agriculture, Mase Manopole, one farmer passed away on Sunday and five more farms were affected in the Kakamas area. READ: Heatwave warning issued for Gauteng "This is harvesting season, so there are a lot of seasonal workers to harvest," Manopole said. "As a result, they are subject to being outside." Manopole says that farmers will be adjusting their times so that they can resume their production work.  #eNCA speaks to Nosey Pieterse from Black Association of the Agricultural sector. #dstv403
