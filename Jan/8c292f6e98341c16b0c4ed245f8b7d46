AFP/William West SYDNEY - The Proteas are gearing up for the third and final Test match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. South Africa will be playing for pride after having already lost the series, with the Baggy Greens boasting an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the three-match series. The first Test took place at the Gabba where Malibongwe Maketa’s charges suffered a six-wicket loss following a shambolic batting performance on a bowler-friendly pitch. Matters didn't improve for South Africa during the Boxing Day test at Melbourne Cricket Ground as they suffered one of their most humiliating defeats, losing by an innings and 182 runs. This sees them slip to fourth position in the ICC World Test Championship points table. Australia lead the table ahead of India and Sri Lanka.
