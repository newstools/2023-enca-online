  JOHANNESBURG - As Eskom implements Stage 6 rolling blackouts indefinitely, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa will, on Thursday, decide on the utility's price hike application. Eskom wants you to pay 32% more for electricity for the next financial year. The embattled utility is looking to recover over R350bn with the hike. The announcement comes after the regulator asked for a number of extensions in making its decision. A final decision on Eskomâ€™s revenue application was meant to be announced in November last year.
