Koen asked the state and the defence to make submissions on whether he should recuse himself. The judge indicated he may have to recuse himself, given some of the “strong” views he expressed, when dismissing the former president’s application for Billy Downer to be removed from the prosecution. Zuma and co-accused French firm Thales face charges of fraud, corruption, and money laundering. We hear from eNCA senior Reporter Dasen Thathiah ahead of tomorrow's proceedings. #DStv403
