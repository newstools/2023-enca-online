AFP/Adrian Dennis PARIS - France captain Hugo Lloris has decided to draw the curtain on his international career. The 2018 FIFA World Cup winner bids farewell to a 14-year career that saw him reach the finals of Euro 2016 before losing to Portugal, and last year’s World Cup, where the French side lost on penalties to Argentina. The Tottenham Hotspur shot-stopper made his international debut in a goalless draw against Uruguay on 19 November 2008. At the Qatar World Cup, Lloris equalled Germany’s Manuel Neuer's record of 19 for the most matches played by a goalkeeper, when he faced Morocco in the semi-final on 14 December. Four days later, in his 20th game, he became the most capped goalkeeper in World Cup history, as Les Bleus lost the final to Argentina. Lloris was awarded the Knight of the Legion of Honour, the highest French order of merit, following his country’s World Cup triumph over Croatia in Russia in 2018.
