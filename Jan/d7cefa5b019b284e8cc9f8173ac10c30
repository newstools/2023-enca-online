The Sharks player is set to join French club Racing 92 after this year's Rugby World Cup in France. Kolisi has signed a deal with the Top 14 outfit until 2026. He becomes the second Bok to confirm his post-World Cup move up north after Steven Kitshoff confirmed he is off to Irish club Ulster. In a heartfelt statement on his social media page, Kolisi says his desire to spend more time with his family played a huge role in his decision. This will be the 31-year-old flanker's first stint outside South Africa, having played at home his entire 11-year professional career. Kolisi will be joining Bok teammate Trevor Nyakane in Paris. Nyakane joined Racing from the Bulls last year. A post shared by Siya Kolisi (@siyakolisi)
