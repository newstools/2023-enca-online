Recently police have warned motorists not to stop along the N1 near De Doorns to buy grapes. They have found that many of these grapes are stolen produce. To discuss this, eNCA speaks to Jannie Strydom, CEO of Agri Western Cape. #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Police have warned motorists not to stop along the N1 near De Doorns to buy grapes as much of the fruit is stolen. Joblessness and poverty have driven up crime in the agricultural sector, often driven by organised syndicates. Agri Western Cape CEO Jannie Strydom has cautioned against buying stolen produce, adding that it's already illegal to sell items on national roads. READ: Street food keeps Joburg going, but vendors' working conditions are unhealthy "I think once a consumer at night or the early mornings finds a single person along a national road selling fruit in dodgy packaging, I think you should use your own discretion in terms of whether that's legitimate or not," Strydom said. "I think it's really difficult to determine because the informal market is a very crucial and important market in our economy, but those vendors, they do obtain permits and they are allowed to trade. But I think what recently happened in De Doorns, and I mean I experienced it myself, because at night [a person] just jumps in front of your car trying to sell grapes. "It's really difficult but I would really like to emphasize the fact that consumers do not support these vendors because once there's no market, then that will definitely assist with limiting the theft on farm level itself."
