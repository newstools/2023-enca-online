  CAPE TOWN - The University of Cape Town's academic staff has voted in favour of strike action for the first time in history. The Academics Union and its members are ready to down tools following a 3% wage increase offer. The union says about 87% of its members are willing to go on strike. It says other institutions have been able to offer employees an increase of about 6%, in line with inflation. The planned three-day strike could be followed by more as soon as the CCMA issues a certificate.
