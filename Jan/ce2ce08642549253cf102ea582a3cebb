Encouraged - Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag LONDON - Erik ten Hag is happy with Manchester United's progress following a 3-0 win over Bournemouth at Old Trafford but warned against complacency after detecting a slight drop in standards against the Cherries. United are level on points with third-placed Newcastle after Tuesday's win at Old Trafford and just one behind Manchester City, who face Chelsea on Thursday ahead of a Manchester derby at Old Trafford on January 14. "I think it (United's form) is really strong but it will only stay strong if we do our jobs, give 100 percent in every situation," said Ten Hag. "I had the feeling (in the) second half some had the feeling the game is gone and the game is never gone. "We saw the reaction of the opponent (Bournemouth), they still believed in it and if they got back to 2-1 they are back in the game." Ten Hag is still waiting to discover the extent of the injury that forced Donny van de Beek off against Bournemouth. Van de Beek's first home league start since May 2021 -- and the first time he had started a league win at home in his United career - lasted just over 45 minutes as he was injured in first-half stoppage time when caught by Marcos Senesi. Van de Beek limped down the tunnel, leaving Ten Hag with an injury worry ahead of Friday's FA Cup tie against Everton and next week's League Cup quarter-final against Charlton. "It is difficult to say," Ten Hag told reporters when asked about the severity of Van de Beek's injury. "We have to wait a minimum of 24 hours. But it doesn't look good."
