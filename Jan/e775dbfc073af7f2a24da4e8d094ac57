File: Eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. AFP/Martin Bureau MIAMI - There is a gaping hole in Usain Bolt's investment account to the tune of R218-million and the fastest man in the world wants to know what happened. Bolt noticed on 11 January that money he'd invested with Jamaican firm Stocks & Securities Limited had done a runner. Bolt's lawyers are reported to have instructed the firm to return the money within the next 10 days or face civil or criminal action. Another report suggests the eight-time Olympic gold medallist is looking to take the case to Kingston's Supreme Court if the money isn't returned in eight days. The money was part of Bolt's lifetime savings for retirement. It's unknown at this stage if this is all the savings he has to his name. SSL has put up an urgent notice on its website informing the public the company is currently under the direction of the Financial Services Commission and it understands the anxiety this has caused.
