Key man: Joelinton (L) scores Newcastle's second goal in a 2-0 League Cup quarter-final win at home to Leicester LONDON - Newcastle midfielder Joelinton has been charged with drink driving, police said Thursday. He was arrested at 0120 GMT on Thursday after police pulled over his vehicle in Newcastle. The 26-year-old Brazilian scored the second goal in Newcastle's 2-0 League Cup quarter-final win over Leicester late Tuesday. "Joelinton Cassio, 26, of Ponteland, has since been charged with driving whilst above the prescribed limit for alcohol," a Northumbria Police spokesperson said. "He is due to appear before magistrates in Newcastle on January 26." Saudi-backed Newcastle are currently an impressive third in the Premier League, nine points behind leaders Arsenal. Newcastle are bidding to end a trophy drought that has seen them go without a major honour since winning the now defunct European Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.
