We made a submission as Cosatu through the National Minimum Wage Commission for the increase of the CPI plus three percent," said Cosatu General Secretary Solly Phetoe. "As Cosatu, we would love that the increase goes up to 10% for this year so that we can then be able to move quickly to the engagement of the living wage."
