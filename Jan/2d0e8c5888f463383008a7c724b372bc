The women's Afcon winner has agreed to join Scotland outfit Glasgow City. The 24-year-old, who had been plying her trade in Sweden, has signed a contract until 2025. Motlhalo will be looking to uphold Banyana's good name at Glasgow City. Janine van Wyk previously played for the club and helped them win a title. Banyana will want the playmaker to find her feet quickly as she is expected to play a big role at the Fifa Women's World Cup. Motlhalo could make her Glasgow City debut against Rangers in the Scottish league this weekend.
