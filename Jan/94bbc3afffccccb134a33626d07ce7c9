But now Democrats have joined the groundswell of criticism and US President Joe Biden last week signed a new law that bans the use of TikTok on government-issued devices. The law also bans TikTok use in the US House of Representatives and Senate. TikTok is the equivalent of "digital fentanyl," said Republican lawmaker Mike Gallagher, one of the leading voices in Congress against China, comparing the app to the deadly opioid.

"We have to ask whether we want the CCP to control what's on the cusp of becoming the most powerful media company in America," Gallagher told NBC. A TikTok spokesperson said that there is "zero truth" to Gallagher's comments and that the CCP "has neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok." The national law matches dozens of government-use bans at the state and local level and now TikTok USA is fighting to survive as a Chinese-owned company, with the growing chance that it will have to divest from ByteDance in order to remain on US smartphones.

But the mood towards TikTok soured considerably last month when ByteDance was forced to admit that employees improperly accessed TikTok data to track journalists in an effort to identify the source of leaks to the media. Criticism has even expanded to other Western countries with French President Emmanuel Macron last month accusing the Chinese social network of censoring content and encouraging online addiction among young people. TikTok staunchly denies that the Chinese government has such controls.
