#DStv403 CAPE TOWN  - The Eskom board will be meeting Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Tuesday morning. Last year Scopa made recommendations on interventions at the ailing power utility. Those reports were adopted by the National Assembly following visits to Medupi and Kusile power stations. Scopa called on Eskom to account for progress and cost overruns, on the new build program.
