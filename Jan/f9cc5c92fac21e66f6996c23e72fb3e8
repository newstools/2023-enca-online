Another victim says that as elections near, the ruling Zanu PF has entered panic mode, turning to violence. However, Zanu PF has distanced itself from the attack, describing the perpetrators as criminals. Police have made three arrests so far regarding the attack. Among them is war veteran Never Chimutashu. Watch the video above for more details on this story.
