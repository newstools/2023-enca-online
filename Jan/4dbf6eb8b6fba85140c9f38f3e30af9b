DA's coalition partner Action SA blamed Phalatse's party, the Democratic Alliance, saying it has neglected her and allowed the ANC to come back into power. Meanwhile, in Ekurhuleni, the Super Seven parties have tabled a motion of no confidence against the Chief Whip of Ekurhuleni Council, Khetha Shandu, and speaker Raymond Dhlamini. Shandu and Dhlamini are accused by the coalition of failing to execute their duties without bias. Watch the video above for more details on this story.
