When Blackpink's Lisa takes to the stage in Bangkok this weekend, seeing her dance in the flesh will be a life defining moment for superfan Nipattanachai Thepkamdee BANGKOK - When Blackpink mega-star Lisa takes to the stage in Bangkok on Saturday, seeing the Thai-born K-pop sensation dance in the flesh will be a life-defining moment for many local superfans.

"She is very charming when she dances and she is the best dancer in the band," said Nipattanachai Thepkamdee, an influencer who goes by the nickname "James" on his TikTok and YouTube fan club channels -- which amass hundreds of thousands of followers. The 21-year-old university student's bedroom resembles a shrine to the girl group, with floor-to-ceiling posters "I like Lisa the most. Partly because of her skills and the fact that she is Thai," he said. The Thai government is also fond of the young rapper. It hailed her as a soft power icon after she wore traditional Thai headgear and performed in front of Phanom Rung stone castle -- a Hindu Khmer Empire temple complex -- in a 2021 music video for her first solo album. "When foreigners think of Lisa, they will definitely think of Thailand," Nipattanachai said. Saturday will be his first Blackpink concert. "I will freak out and probably cry, because I really, really want to see them live once in my life," he said.
