Duvenage is encouraging motorists to stop paying for e-tolls as the system is expected to be scrapped.

"They have made the commitment that the refunding is gonna be alternative to e-tolls, it’s gonna be financed through National Treasury and somewhat from Gauteng revenues," he said. "It’s less about the arrangements that we made between national and provincial governments and more about turning the system off because nobody is paying or very few people are paying.

"So everyone should just stop paying now. There are no consequences for those who don’t pay. Nothing at all. "So really, just stop paying and that might speed things up a little.”
