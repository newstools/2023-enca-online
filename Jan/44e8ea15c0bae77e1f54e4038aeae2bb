Mkhondo House in Mpumalanga had everything in place, even before the end of the year. But earlier this week, the principal's worst nightmare became a reality. Criminals took advantage of power cuts and burgled and damaged the school. "It’s indeed a very sad day," said founder and principal, Eugene Nel. "We spent so much last year to get everything ready.” Windows are broken, classroom door locks were broken, door frames damaged and some of the urinals were also stolen. And the worst of all, all the water pipes had been removed. * eNCA's Genee White filed this report.
