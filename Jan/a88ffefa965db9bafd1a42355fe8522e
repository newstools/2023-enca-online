Alleged sex kingpin Gerhard Ackerman. JOHANNESBURG - Alleged child sex-ring kingpin Gerhard Ackerman has been re-arrested. He was recognised by members of the public in Florida, west of Johannesburg. A warrant of arrest had been issued after he failed to appear before the high court in Johannesburg, citing ill-health. Ackerman faces more than 740 counts, including rape, attempted murder, the production and distribution of child pornography, and human trafficking. Ackerman and his co-accused Paul Kennedy are alleged to have lured boys into a sex ring. The boys were allegedly sexually groomed, raped and exposed to pornographic material. Kennedy has since committed suicide.
