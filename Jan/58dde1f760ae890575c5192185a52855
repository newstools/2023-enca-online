File: A lightbulb. Pixabay/WolfBlur  JOHANNESBURG - Beleaguered Eskom says rolling stage four blackouts will continue until further notice. The power utility says generating units at Camden, Grootvlei, Lethabo and Majuba power stations suffered breakdowns. Other units have been taken offline for repairs. While units at Kriel and Lethabo power stations have been returned to service, there's been a delay in returning units at Duvha, Matla and Tutuka power stations.
