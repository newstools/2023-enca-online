READ: Consumer inflation dips slightly in December It says eggs are staying on shop shelves because lower-income earners cannot afford the cheapest animal protein. "Eggs have always been that option for the consumer if the other animal protein sources are not affordable, so we're seeing that again in the market that even though eggs are still the most affordable animal protein source, it's still difficult for consumers to afford that product," said Dr Abongile Balarane from the South African Poultry Association's Egg Organisation. "We've been seeing a number of promotions in supermarkets as a way to encourage consumers but the problem is the affordability is not there for the South African consumer."
