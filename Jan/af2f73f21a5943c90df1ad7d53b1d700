Russia's Daniil Medvedev hits a return against Sebastian Korda of the US during their men's singles match. AFP/William West MELBOURNE -Â Daniil Medvedev on Friday became the latest title contender to crash out of the men's draw at the Australian Open. Russia's Medvedev was runner-up at the last two Grand Slams in Melbourne but his tournament ended with a whimper in round three at the hands of Sebastian Korda. The American, son of 1998 Australian Open champion Petr Korda, won 7-6 (9/7), 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) as seventh seed Medvedev followed defending champion Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud in exiting in the first week. Korda, who faces 10th seed Hubert Hurkacz of Poland next, told Rod Laver Arena: "An unbelievable match. "I sort of knew what I had to do and I stuck with it even when I was going up and down with the emotions. "I'm thrilled right now, I played amazing," said the 22-year-old. With world number one Carlos Alcaraz not involved because of injury, Medvedev's surprise defeat to the 29th seed is another boost to nine-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic. The hot favourite, who is nursing a hamstring problem, plays 27th seed Grigor Dimitrov on Saturday. Stefanos Tsitsipas is now the highest remaining seed at three and the Greek star stretched his unbeaten streak this year to set up a last-16 clash with Italian Jannik Sinner. The 24-year-old Tsitsipas, who is yet to drop a set, clinched his seventh straight win of 2023 by beating Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-2, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3. Tsitsipas is refusing to get carried away as he chases a first major title. "There are no presents," he warned. "You should be going after it, you should be creating those opportunities and aiming big within yourself, sometimes surpass your own abilities."
