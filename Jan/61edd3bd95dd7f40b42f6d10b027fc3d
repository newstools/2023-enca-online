Alleged sex kingpin Gerhard Ackerman. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Johannesburg has issued a warrant of arrest for alleged sex kingpin Gerhard Ackerman. That's after he failed to appear in court on Thursday, saying he was not feeling well. The State approached the court to have Ackerman's bail revoked for his failure to comply with a court order to furnish the State with a doctor's note. He faces over 700 charges ranging from rape, attempted murder, distribution of child pornography and human trafficking of minor children for sexual exploitation. Ackerman and his co-accused Acting Judge Paul Kennedy are alleged to have lured boys into a sex ring. The boys were allegedly sexually groomed, raped and exposed to pornographic material. Kennedy has since committed suicide.
