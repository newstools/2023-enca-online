File: A general view of the headquarters of Eskom. AFP/Gianluigi Guercia  JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has plunged the country back into Stage 5 and 6 power cuts. Stage 5 is in effect until 9pm on Tuesday. The utility says this will be ramped up to Stage 6 from 9pm until 5am on Wednesday. Stage 5 will then be implemented until further notice. The embattled utility says this is due to capacity constraints. Eskom says the breakdown of six generating units at various power stations is to blame.  #PowerAlert1
