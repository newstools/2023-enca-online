Berrettini broke Ruud once in each set for a clinical 6-4, 6-4 triumph that gave Italy an unassailable 3-0 lead over Norway ahead of the second women's singles and mixed doubles. Italy will play either Poland or Switzerland in the Brisbane final, with the victor of that tie to be decided later Tuesday. The winner of each city final in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth will play the semi-finals in Sydney, along with the best-performing team from the beaten finalists. Ruud, who had a brilliant 2022, went into the match as the slight favourite, but Berrettini was superb from the outset. He served well throughout and his powerful groundstrokes put the Norwegian under enormous pressure. Berrettini hit 10 aces and eight forehand winners, with the power and placement of his shot-making causing big problems. Berrettini, who has slipped to 16th in the world, said he knew he had to serve well against Ruud. "He's improved so much in the last year so I knew that I had to serve my best," he said. "We know each other pretty well so I knew I had to serve like that, but it's one thing knowing I had to and one thing doing it."
