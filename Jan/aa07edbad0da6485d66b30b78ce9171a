That is the demand from Numsa, Build One South Africa and the UDM. The three are part of the group that's filed court papers against government and Eskom. READ: SA’s electricity crisis | Eskom served with letter of demand over blackouts A letter of demand with a deadline of 20 January was issued, but the group says Eskom and other involved parties missed the deadline. They are demanding full transparency from the power utility and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan around power cuts. READ: Eskom plans switch between Stage 2 and 3 blackouts over next 2 years Numsa's Irvin Jim says South Africans should not accept the current situation. "One of the things we must reject and reject absolutely is this nonsense of being hypnotised that we must accept that for two years we must live in darkness," Jim said. "We want electricity, tomorrow we want rolling blackouts to stop." #eNCA Courtesy #DStv403
