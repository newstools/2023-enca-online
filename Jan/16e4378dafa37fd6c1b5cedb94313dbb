Newly elected ANC top seven. JOHANNESBURG -  The ANC wants more money from the state. The cash-strapped party says the allocation by the IEC is not enough. It also wants the Political Funding Act to be reviewed as it says the law has made donors reluctant to donate. The act requires political parties to disclose donations of over a R100,000. Treasurer-General Gwen Ramokgopa says funding political parties will sustain democracy. “But we believe as we have taken a resolution that public funding is the way to go. We do have our fair share now from the IEC, not adequate but it’s an experiment that we are looking at. We are still benchmarking also with advanced democracies. We believe that public funding of political parties that are in parliament is the way to go to sustain our democracy,” said Ramokgopa.
