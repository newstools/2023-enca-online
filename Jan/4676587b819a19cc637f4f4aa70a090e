 JOHANNESBURG - Eskom will on Sunday update South Africans on its current system challenges. The country has been waiting to hear from Eskom since it implemented Stage 6 blackouts earlier this month. It's since been downgraded and is now at Stage 2, but blackouts have already caused much damage to households and businesses. Farmers have been the latest to come out in protest saying the unsteady power supply is affecting the industry. They warn this will cause food shortages and could lead to food insecurity in the country.
