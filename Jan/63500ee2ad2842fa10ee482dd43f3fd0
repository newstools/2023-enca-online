Under pressure - Everton manager Frank Lampard LONDON - Everton manager Frank Lampard said his focus is on preparing the side for Friday's FA Cup tie against Manchester United after another crushing defeat left his job seemingly hanging by a thread. Tuesday's 4-1 loss at home to Brighton, where the Toffees conceded three goals in six second-half minutes, meant the Merseysiders had accrued just five points from their last 10 Premier League matches. A relegation battle for a second successive season is now assured, with Lampard saying it's up to him and his players to raise their game. "It's not time to go into dressing-room talk after a result like that," he said. "I've been there before and it's about taking personal responsibility -- every player and myself. "We're all in it together, it's not a question of anger. We're all disappointed, we all want to win games. "That's for us to get right. Manchester United comes in a few days." The former Derby and Chelsea manager added: "It's about, 'What can I do better?' and as long as you do that and don't look left or right at anyone else, that's the only reaction you can have. "The first half (against Brighton) I didn't hate but obviously the six minutes (in the second half) is not good enough from us and if you are going to perform like that and defensively then you are going to lose games. "We have to fight for consistency, for sure." The omens for Lampard's future at Goodison Park are far from encouraging given owner Farhad Moshiri has sacked five managers in almost seven years since becoming Everton's majority shareholder. Lampard has a worse record than all those predecessors -- Roberto Martinez, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce, Marco Silva and, most recently, Rafael Benitez -- averaging just 0.97 points per game. He has won nine and lost 19 of the 36 Premier League matches for which he has been in charge since taking over last January.
