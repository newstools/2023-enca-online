AFP/Marco Longari JOHANNESBURG - The stage is set, for the battle over the ANC's cadre deployment policy. The High Court in Pretoria has set aside two days to hear the DA's application to have the policy declared unlawful and unconstitutional. The main opposition has accused the ANC of illegally interfering in appointments to ensure members are appointed based on loyalty to the ANC rather than their merit and skills. The DA says this is the single most important court case for rebuilding state capacity. It cites the Zondo Commission of Inquiry, which found the policy helped fuel state capture. Earlier, the ANC and DA leaders, Cyril Ramaphosa and John Steenhuisen submitted affidavits to court, where their lawyers will now argue the merits of the case.
