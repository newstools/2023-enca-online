In his weekly newsletter, president Cyril Ramaphosa says government is looking at different mechanisms to address the rising cost of electricity. These include measures such as, supporting households with rechargeable lights, and working with school pupils to catch up on lessons interrupted by rolling blackouts. He says further information on these, and other initiatives will be provided in the coming weeks. The President's comments come after the National Energy Regulator granted an 18.65 percent increase in electricity tariffs for Eskom. The President indicated that the tariffs are necessary for Eskomâ€™s financial sustainability.
