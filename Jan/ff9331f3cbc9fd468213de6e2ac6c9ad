This follows clashes between police and the community who were blocking roads on Wednesday, demanding that power be restored in the area. Clinic staff were caught in the crossfire, and NEHAWU is now calling on the health department to intervene. "The plan is that until there's an assurance by the department that the working environment is safe, workers aren't going back to work," said Prince Mthalane. "At this stage there's no safety guaranteed, so we're not going to allow our workers to go and work in a non-safe environment."
