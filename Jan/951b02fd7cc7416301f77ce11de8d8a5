The Tshwane club announced that White has undergone successful emergency abdominal surgery. According to the report, White had felt unwell during the Bulls' recent trip to Wales. Although he seemed to recover during the trip, he complained of debilitating stomach cramps on his return to South Africa on Sunday morning. He was then rushed to a hospital. White is expected to make a full recovery and will return to his role in due time, but he'll be taking a break from his duties until at least early February.
