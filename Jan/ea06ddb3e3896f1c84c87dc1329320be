Chelsea's Mykhailo Mudryk could make his debut against Liverpool on Saturday. AFP/Ben Stansall LONDON - Graham Potter says Chelsea's new £88-million winger Mykhailo Mudryk is set to make his debut in Saturday's clash with Liverpool. Chelsea boss Potter landed Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday after Premier League leaders Arsenal appeared on the verge of signing him. The 22-year-old was paraded in front of Chelsea fans on the pitch at half-time of Sunday's 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. Mudryk has trained with his new teammates this week and Potter is likely to use him at some stage at Anfield this weekend. "Yeah, there's a chance (he will feature). "It's how much he can do. I think 90 minutes, no. There's probably a role for him at some stage in the game," Potter told reporters on Friday. "He's obviously come from a mid-season break, so hasn't played so much football recently but has been training well. We'll assess him and see how much he can play at the weekend." With Chelsea struggling in 10th place in the Premier League, Potter hopes the skilful Mudryk can prove the spark to ignite his team. "He's a young player, exciting player, fantastic speed one v one, can attack the backline and now we've just got to help him adapt to the Premier League, adapt to us," he said. Mudryk might not be the last signing of a busy January window for Potter, who has already brought in Joao Felix, Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana and Andrey Santos.
