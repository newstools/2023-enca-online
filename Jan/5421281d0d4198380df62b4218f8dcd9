Last year, the company approached the Grahamstown High Court to force government to implement a plan of action to protect long-distance bus drivers and passengers. The court granted the order and Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula's bid for leave to appeal the ruling was dismissed this week. Intercape says it's been the target of over one-hundred and fifty incidents over the last year. CEO Johann Ferreira says the current plan from authorities is not good enough.
