#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - The community of uMzimkhulu is up in arms. Their life-saving local clinic is in danger of closing its doors, leaving patients with the possibility of having to travel far to receive treatment. They say their pleas to keep the facility open have fallen on deaf ears, with little to no communication from authorities. The facility services over 15,000 people in the area, seeing over 100 people per day. Local mayor Jabu Msiya insists that this is a positive move that will be beneficial to the residents. Despite Msiya's comments, the department of health -- through their spokesperson -- says they have not made any pronouncements about the closure of the clinic. * eNCA’s Nqobile Madlala reports.
