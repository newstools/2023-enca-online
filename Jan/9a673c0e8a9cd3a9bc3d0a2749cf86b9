File: England's Owen Farrell seen during practice. AFP/Pool LONDON -Â Owen Farrell is set to feature for England in their opening Six Nations clash against Scotland. This comes after he was slapped with a four-week ban for a dangerous tackle. Farrell's ban will be reduced to three weeks if he completes world rugby's intervention coaching programme. Accomplishing this would allow England Coach Steve Borthwick to pick Farrell on February 4th. With Marcus Smith and George Ford out injured, having Farrell as an additional option is going to ease the pressure at number 10.
