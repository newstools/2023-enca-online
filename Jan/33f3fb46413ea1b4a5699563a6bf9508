eNCA's Slindelo Masikane reports. #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - Two days is how long the ANC says it will take to conclude outstanding work from the 55th National Elective Conference. The party failed to get through its programme at NASREC last month and had to adjourn to 5 January. The proceedings were marred by the slow pace of registration, delaying the start of the conference by two days. eNCA senior Reporter Silindelo Masikane has more details in the video above.
