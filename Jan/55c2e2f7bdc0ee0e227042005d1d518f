Aryna Sabalenka powered into the Adelaide International semi-finals. AFP/Brenton Edwards ADELAIDE - World number five Aryna Sabalenka held off Marketa Vondrousova to book her place in the Adelaide International semi-finals on Friday in a boost to her Australian Open preparations. The Belarusian overcame hot conditions to dismiss her Czech opponent 6-3, 7-5 in 1hr 34mins to continue her strong 2022 late-season form where she finished runner-up at the WTA Finals. The second seed's reward is a last-four clash with Russian world number nine Veronika Kudermetova or Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu. "It was a tough match and she fought until the end and I was really happy I was able to win this match," Sabalenka, who is yet to win a Grand Slam, said. "I think because I'm staying really calm and I feel like I'm at home here, that's why I play really well. "I haven't dropped a set yet. Hopefully I'll keep going like that." Sabalenka broke for 3-2 in the first set and closed the set out on her 15th winner. A double break in the second set put her 4-1 ahead before Vondrousova battled back, only to be denied as the Belarusian regrouped to take the match. The Australian Open starts in less than two weeks.
