#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says registration problems in Gauteng did not come with the online admissions system. Over 1,000 children are still to be placed in schools. Many were not placed at schools within walking distance to their homes. Parents have called for the online system be scrapped and that the department reverts to the old system where they were going directly to schools. Motshekga says the problems are not new.
