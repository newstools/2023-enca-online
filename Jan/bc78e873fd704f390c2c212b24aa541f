AFP/Sebastien Bozon MELBOURNE -Â After the withdrawal of Naomi Osaka and Venus Williams, the Australian Open organisers hope there will be no further bad news. However, Emma Raducanu might add to the growing list of absentees. The 20-year-old revealed that she hopes to be fit for the first grand slam of the year. The Briton retired from her second-round match at the ASB Classic in Auckland on Thursday after slipping and rolling her left ankle. Raducanu left the court in tears during the second set against Slovakia's Viktoria Kuzmova, with the score 6-0 5-7. The Grand Slam begins next Monday, with the full extent of the 2021 US Open champion's injury yet to be diagnosed.
