The men from Johannesburg were beaten by Stade Francais in Paris. It had looked promising for the Lions, who scored early and led 7-nil at half-time. Ill discipline resulted in three second-half yellow cards for the visitors. Stade Francais took advantage, scoring a try and four penalties. The home side would take the honours 17-7. The Lions are third in the EPCR Challenge Cup's Pool B, with one win and two defeats.
