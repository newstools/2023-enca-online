The US House of Representatives limped to an adjournment after conservative hardliners blocked establishment favourite Kevin McCarthy from becoming speaker. AFP/Olivier Douliery WASHINGTON - The US House of Representatives has once again adjourned without electing a new speaker after six rounds of voting. This as some Republicans failed to back the party's Kevin McCarthy as the New House Speaker. About 20 Republicans on the party's far-right wing are refusing to support McCarthy for ideological reasons. This is despite a call for unity from former US President Donald Trump. McCarthy secured only 201 of the 218 votes needed, while 20 Republicans voted for Byron Donalds, who was first elected in 2020.

US President Joe Biden described the incident as embarrassing. The stalemate has left the chamber unable to swear in members, fill committees, adopt rules for legislating or negotiate a path through the paralysis. The House adjourned until noon on Thursday after the sixth indecisive ballot, allowing the Republicans a few precious hours to regroup and settle on a new strategy before going back into the fray. - Additional reporting AFP
