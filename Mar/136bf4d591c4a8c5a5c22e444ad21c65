#eNCA speaks to Minister of Home Affairs Dr Aaron Motsoaledi. #DStv403 PRETORIA - The High Court in Pretoria has upheld a ruling that a group of 22 Afghan asylum seekers should be allowed into the country. Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi initially opposed their bid to apply for asylum, saying our sovereignty is being abused. READ: Home Affairs unhappy with Afghan asylum seeker court ruling Last month, the department received a letter from a law firm representing Afghan nationals arguing that they should be allowed to go through the application process. "Right from the beginning they've been insulting us and they still continue to do so," the minister said. "The court ruling is insistent that we must allow them to come in and apply for asylum."
