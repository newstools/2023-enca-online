AFP/Claus Fisker COPENHAGEN -Â Danish brewer Carlsberg announced that its CEO Cees 't Hart would be retiring, as the group is completing the sale of its considerable Russian assets. The 65-year-old Dutchman, who has led the Danish beermaker for the last eight years, "has decided to retire" the company said in a statement adding that he had informed the company's board his intention to leave by the end of the third quarter of 2023 at the latest. "Staying on board for another half a year will allow me and the team to continue delivering on our challenging plans for 2023 and accomplishing the sale of the Russian business before the summer" Hart was quoted as saying. The search for his successor is "ongoing" and will be announced "in due course", the company said. Hart's decision comes as the group expects a challenging year in 2023, with the ongoing sale of its very large Russian operations, which was announced following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Weighed by impairments totalling over 10 billion kroner ($1.4-billion), Carlsberg ended 2022 with net loss of 1.06 billion kronor for the full year.
