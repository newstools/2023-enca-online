  JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says that the Public Enterprises ministry will cease to exist in the next administration. IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa asked the President if the DPE would be dissolved and state-owned enterprises put under their line function departments.    At the same time, Ramaphosa said South Africa's greylisting is of great concern. He says discussions are being held on the subject, and there are plans to get as many African countries out of greylisting. He was speaking during his question and answer session in the National Assembly.
