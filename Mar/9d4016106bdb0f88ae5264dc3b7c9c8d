New Zealand's Ardie Savea. AFP/Marty Melville WELLINGTON - Ardie Savea has found himself in hot water. The Hurricanes captain has been suspended from playing for a week, after making a throat-slitting gesture to an opponent. The incident happened during an encounter with the Melbourne Rebels on Friday. The 29-year-old received a yellow card just before the incident.

He later apologised for the incident, but a judiciary committee saw it fitting to hand him the suspension. The committee says Savea displayed ‘unsportsmanlike play’ which cast a cloud over his team’s 39-33 win. Former All Blacks winger John Kirwan spoke out saying Savea was being punished harshly considering that the same gesture is often used in the haka.
