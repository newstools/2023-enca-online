He has called for peaceful and non-violent action to allow non-striking healthcare personnel to exercise their constitutional right to work without being intimidated or victimised. READ: Nehawu vows to intensify protests The union, however, says they are negotiating with people who are intent on collapsing the public service by declaring war on workers. "I don't know why the health minister is saying all the things he is saying as if the strike is a healthcare strike, this is not a health sector strike, it is a public service strike," said Nehawu Deputy General-Secretary December Mavuso. "It is workers in Home Affairs and other departments that are on strike and only a section of the health care sector, those who are not designanted as essential health care services."
