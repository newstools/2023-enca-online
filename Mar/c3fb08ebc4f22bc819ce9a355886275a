AFP/Roberto Schmidt PRETORIA -Â Mamelodi Sundowns are one step away from booking their ticket into the knockout phase of the CAF Champions League when they welcome Al Ahly at Loftus on Saturday. Sundowns drew 2-all against the Red Devils in Cairo the last time out breaking their 16-game win streak in all formats of the game. The 2016/2017 African champions will work towards keeping the flow of the game tight against their opponents as Sundowns boast one loss in 31 home games in all competitions. In support of their winning pursuit, the lethal combo of Peter Shaulile and Caisus Mailula share 29 goals between them. The Loftus crowd should also weigh in on the visitors who have not touched silverware since 2021. In contrast to the South Africans, Ahly have registered two wins in eight games on the road and will have to put in a full shift to avoid Sundowns producing a fifth win in nine games. Kick-off is at 3pm.
