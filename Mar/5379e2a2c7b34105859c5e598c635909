In the preliminary report, President Cyril Ramaphosa has been cleared of any wrongdoing in the Phala Phala farm scandal. Acting Public Protector Kholeka Gcaleka has found Ramaphosa did not contravene the Executive Ethics code. READ: President Ramaphosa cleared in preliminary Phala Phala report Party leader John Steenhuisen says it is premature of the Presidency to dismiss the matter as the investigation continues. "It is very unfortunate that the report has been leaked because it is a preliminary report, nobody has finally been accused and nobody has been exonerated," he said. "There is a period now for parties to submit their responses within ten days to this preliminary report, thereafter a final report will be made." Steenhuisen has also rejected the Presidency's position that Ramaphosa is a victim of crime. Watch the video above for more details.
