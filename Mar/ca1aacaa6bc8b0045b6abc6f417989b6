Jonathan Danty (C) made his France debut in 2016. AFP/Franck Fife PARIS - France head coach Fabien Galthie said on Thursday that Jonathan Danty was eager to face England this weekend after being selected for the game. La Rochelle's Danty replaces Yoram Moefana, who is on the bench, in one of three changes from victory over Scotland in the last round. Danty, a powerful ball carrier, made the last of his 19 Test appearances in November and has played three club games since recovering from a knee injury. "I bumped into Jonathan this morning and I said 'I'm sure the journalists are going to ask something about you. Do you have something to say?" Galthie told reporters. "His response was short, he's said he was keen. "With that he said everything. We understood all he needed to say," he added. In the second change, Toulouse tight-head prop Dorian Aldegheri comes in for the banned Mohamed Haouas with Sipili Falatea on the bench for a fourth straight Test. Aldegheri will line up alongside club teammates Julien Marchand and Cyril Baille in the front row. "The connection between the players meant linking him with Julien and Cyril," Galthie said. "They've known each other since childhood pretty much at Toulouse. There's something powerful there. "We preferred starting with this front three and when we need Sipili, he will bring all the energy needed to finish the match," Galthie added. The final change sees flanker Francois Cros taking the place of injured Anthony Jelonch for Saturday's game at Twickenham. Les Bleus can still retain the Championship but need other results to go their way after victories over Italy and Scotland came either side of defeat to Ireland in round two. France last won at Twickenham in 2007. They will host this year's Rugby World Cup which starts on September 8.
