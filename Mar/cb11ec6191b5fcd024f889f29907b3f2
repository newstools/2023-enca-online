File: Rugby coach John Plumtree. AFP DURBAN - The Sharks have been without a head coach for more than three months and the Durban outfit are reportedly set to appoint former All Blacks assistant coach John Plumtree in the vacant post. The post is currently held by the team’s director of rugby, Neil Powell. Plumtree will be taking over from Sean Everitt, who parted ways with the Sharks in late November last year. Plumtree is no stranger to the Shark Tank, having worked as assistant coach of the side that made the Super 14 final in 2007 and coaching the Sharks to their first Currie Cup title since 1996. He stayed at the Sharks until 2012 before leaving to gain experience coaching teams of Ireland, the Hurricanes, Japan and the All Blacks.
