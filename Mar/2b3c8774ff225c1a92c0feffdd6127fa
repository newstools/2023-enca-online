Harry and Meghan moved to California in 2020 after dramatically quitting royal life. AFP/Pool LONDON - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are being evicted from their home on the British royal family's Windsor estate, leaving them without a UK base, reports said on Wednesday. Frogmore Cottage, which they refurbished at a reported cost of £2.4-million, had been a wedding present from the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2018. It has now been offered to Prince Andrew, King Charles III's disgraced brother, reports in The Sun and Daily Telegraph said.
