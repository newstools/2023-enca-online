  EKURHULENI - The City of Ekurhuleni has condemned the brutal murder of contractors in Germiston. They were called out to Klippoortjie after an electrician requested assistance following a cable fault. When they approached the scene community members pushed the contractors' vehicle over the bridge and set it alight. The mob then assaulted the contractors with various objects â€“ killing four of them. The city says no work will be done in the area until the safety of workers has been guaranteed. It's not yet clear why the attack took place.
