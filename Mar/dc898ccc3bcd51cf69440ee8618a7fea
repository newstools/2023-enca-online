The department offered a 4.7-percent increase, while unions are demanding between 10 and 12-percent. Shingange said, "we want to confirm the strike is continuing tomorrow. Leadership is already in place on the ground to continue the strike." "People who don't want to negotiate will go to court but as for the rest of us as workers, we are going to the streets tomorrow. We are going on a strike nothing has changed. We have responded to the court order. The matter is before court. As of now, the strike is proceeding."
