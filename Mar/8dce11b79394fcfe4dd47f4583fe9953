They're demanding a salary increase of 10-percent, among a wide range of issues.

The matter is set to be heard at CCMA this month. Nehawu Wits' Thabo Modise said, "now the annual average CPI for 2022 is sitting at 6.9-percent very high, meaning cost of living is very high...now the university is ignoring things like CPI, cost of living, petrol...we're demanding a 10-percent salary increase, the university is offering us something way below that." "So we referred the matter to the CCMA, as we speak on the 16 March there'll be a showdown between us and Wits management at the CCMA."
