File: Rugby balls JOHANNESBURG - The Springbok Women will return to action after a long lay-off for the national side since the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand last September. South African Rugby has confirmed the Bok Women will play Canada and Spain in Madrid this month. They will face Canada on 25 March, followed by a test against the hosts, Spain at the same venue on 1 April. Both matches will take place at the Estadio Nacional de la Universidad Complutense. The SA women are still without a head coach after Stanley Raubenheimer's contract was not renewed. Meanwhile, SA Rugby’s High-Performance Manager for Women’s Rugby, Lynne Cantwell, said the opportunity to play Canada and Spain could not come at a better time for the Springbok Women.
