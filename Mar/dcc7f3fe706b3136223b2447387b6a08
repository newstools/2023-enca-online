READ:Â Education in Crisis | Wits SRC meets management The Socialist Youth Movement's Humairaa Mayet said, "ultimately the only solution is free decolonised quality education, at best, everything else the university can do, and every university in the country can do is a temporary solution." "For example, extending the registration period, as we know, registration closed on Friday but by extending it, Wits will at least give students some more time to register." "Another big issue is that of financial exclusion, by excluding students, Wits is essentially making everything more difficult, and we are likely to see this have a ripple effect across the country. So ultimately we think that lifting financial exclusion, extending the registration period, allowing every student to be accommodated is just a temporary solution because year in and year out, this will happen again if we do not achieve free quality decolonised education around the country."
