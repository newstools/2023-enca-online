Residents of Makhanda in the Eastern Cape are being subjected to water restrictions following a delay in the Makhanda water project. #eNCA speaks to Makana Residents Association with committee member, Sally Price-Smith. #eNCA #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Just 50 litres of water a day. That's all residents of Makhanda in the Eastern Cape get if they get any at all. They say the water supply is erratic at best. This is all due to delays in the multi-million rand Makhanda water project. It was supposed to be completed way back in 2017. The local residents association says getting any information is like pulling teeth.
