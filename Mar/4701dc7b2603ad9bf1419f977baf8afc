#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - A date for the trial of accused July 2021 instigator, Bonginkosi Khanyile has been set. The trial is expected to take place over three months from 11 to 14 December 2023 and from 22 January to 3 February 2023. Khanyile is, however, unhappy. "We thought the trial date will be some time sooner," he said. "If you are saying the trial date will be in December, then you must relax the bail conditions," he adds. Khanyile says he is being punished before he gets punished. The unrest led to the deaths of over 300 people during widespread looting and mall fires. The unrest was seen as a retaliation to the arrest of former president Jacob Zuma. Khanyile will know his fate in roughly 9 months and the state says it is prepared. Over thirty people have been arrested in connection with the violence.
