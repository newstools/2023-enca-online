Residents of Makhanda in the Eastern Cape are being subjected to water restrictions following a delay in the Makhanda water project. #eNCA speaks to Makana Residents Association with committee member, Sally Price-Smith. #eNCA #DStv403 MAKHANDA - 50 litres of water a day is all residents of Makhanda get, if they get any at all. They say water supply is erratic due to delays in the multi-million rand Makhanda water project. WATCH: Makhanda residents get little to no water It was supposed to be completed back in 2017, but it hasn't and local residents association says getting any information is like pulling teeth. Makhanda Residents Association's Sally Price-Smith said, "While it we may have a restriction of 50l a day, actually what we're experiencing in Makhanda is one day of water on, one day of water off...in areas like Allandale they're receiving water maybe two days a week." "We've had endless promises."
