Public service strike | DPSA interdicts Nehawu's planned strike JOHANNESBURG - Nehawu's planned public service strike has been interdicted. The union had applied to go on an indefinite strike from Monday. READ:Â Public sector strike looming The Public Service and Administration Department offered a 4.7-percent increase, while unions are demanding between 10 and 12-percent. The department says government respects the rights of trade unions to organise, and the rights of members to go on peaceful and lawful protests. But it says government has to ensure they happen in a manner that does not disrupt service delivery, especially essential services. Government wants the unions to go back to the Bargaining Chamber to negotiate and resolve the matters through dialogue. This follows a breakdown of negotiations in February. Nehawu says it is meeting over the decision and will give feedback on Sunday afternoon.
