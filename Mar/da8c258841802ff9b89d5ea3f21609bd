The union places the blame squarely at government's door for refusing to meet its wage demands. On Thursday, Health Minister Joe Phaahla said the four deaths could be directly linked to the strike.

"Unfortunately, it's a situation where we've lost young ones with a potential of being the president of the country tomorrow, but it can't be associated with us, we can't be accused," he says.
