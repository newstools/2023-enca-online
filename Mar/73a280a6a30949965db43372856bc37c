West Indies' Kemar Roach's (R) 11th five-wicket Test haul gave his side a fighting chance of winning the first Test against hosts South Africa. AFP/Phill Magakoe CENTURION - The seaming wicket at Centurion’s SuperSport Park seems to persist as South Africa’s batting unit fell apart in the first session against the West Indies in the first test. Following a second day that saw both sides struggle with the bat and bowlers claiming 16 wickets, the Windies made early inroads on Thursday morning. South Africa started on 49/4, with an advantage of 179 before Heinrich Klaasen got bowled by Jason Holder. Kemar Roach recorded three wickets this morning, dismissing Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen and Gerald Coetzee. Shannon Gabriel bowled out Senuran Muthusamy as Proteas limped past the 100-run mark in their second innings. South Africa posted 116 all-out in 28 overs and the West Indies are on the crease batting for their second innings.
