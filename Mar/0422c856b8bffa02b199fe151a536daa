#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Citrus farmers are feeling the squeeze of new European Union regulations. The laws require a level of cooling to prevent the spread of false-coddling-moth disease. However, the Citrus Growers Association says 99% of oranges entering the EU are pest-free. Farmers want Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel to intervene. The EU requires all oranges shipped to the continent be precooled to below 2 degrees Celsius. They also need to be maintained at that temperature for 25 days. Due to power cuts, the industry says they will have to invest around R1.4 billion to comply. Even then, growers will not be ready to meet the regulations by the start of the season and R500 million worth of exports are at stake.
