Former City of Tshwane mayor, Dr Kgosietsho Ramokgopa has been charged with solving the ongoing energy crisis as Electricity Minister. Ramokgopa was the head of infrastructure in the Presidency prior to this appointment. His primary task will be to reduce the severity and frequency of rolling blackouts in the country. He will also have political authority for all aspects of the energy action plan. Ramaphosa has also made changes to the line-up of deputy ministers. He says he hopes the new members of Cabinet will help address the challenges South Africa faces.
