Joni Mitchell, shown at the MusiCares gala in April 2022, will receive the 2023 Gershwin songwriting honour from the US Library of Congress. AFP/Valerie Macon WASHINGTON - Joni Mitchell, the pioneering singer-songwriter behind poignant hits including "A Case Of You," was set to receive a national lifetime achievement award at a star-studded gala celebrating her vast contributions to popular song. The Canadian-born artist joins an elite coterie of composers including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Tony Bennett and Carole King in receiving the US Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize, which is named for the brothers behind American standards such as "I Got Rhythm" and "Rhapsody In Blue." A-listers including James Taylor, Annie Lennox, Herbie Hancock and Graham Nash were primed to pay homage to Mitchell's life and work at the concert ceremony, which will be broadcast on March 31. The trailblazing Mitchell (79) has experienced something of a renaissance over the past year, making a return to public life after she suffered a brain aneurysm in 2015 that left her temporarily unable to speak. She has since undergone extensive physical therapy that's allowed her even to return to performance, which at one point seemed a long shot. Last summer she delivered her first full set in more than 20 years, surprising attendees at the Newport Folk Festival alongside folk-rocker Brandi Carlile, who was also on deck to perform Wednesday. That show followed Mitchell's stage cameo earlier in 2022, when she joined other artists as they performed a moving tribute to her life's work at the MusiCares pre-Grammy gala. Mitchell had last appeared at Newport, an annual festival in Rhode Island, in 1969. She's slated to headline a "Joni Jam" show this June at Washington state'sÂ Gorge Amphitheatre, again alongside Carlile.
