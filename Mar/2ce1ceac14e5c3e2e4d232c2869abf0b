The Presidency has confirmed that changes will be made but only in the next few days. There are obvious positions that need to be filled after the departures of Ayanda Dlodlo and deputy president David Mabuza. READ: No word yet on cabinet reshuffle Fikile Mbalula will also have to be replaced following his election as ANC secretary general, assuming a permanent role at Luthuli House. But will the reshuffle bring economic relief, fewer powers cuts, or in any way change the country for the better? * eNCA's Aviwe Mtila reports.
