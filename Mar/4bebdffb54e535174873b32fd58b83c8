CAPE TOWN - Parliament proceedings into suspended public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's fitness to hold office continue today. Her predecessor Thuli Madonsela, is expected to give oral evidence that will focus on the Vrede Dairy Farm and CIEX investigations. Madonsela was initially set to testify last week, but the committee decided a written statement would be enough. But that has since changed again.
