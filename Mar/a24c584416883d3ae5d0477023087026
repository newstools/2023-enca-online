Diversified industrial group Bidvest has reported double-digit interim profits. CEO Mpumi Madisa has more. #dstv403 JOHANNESBURG -Â Diversified industrial group Bidvest has reported double-digit interim profits. But it warns that consumers will come under increased financial pressure this year. Bidvest's portfolio includes freight, consumer and commercial products, as well as financial services. The group is often used as a gauge of the economy's performance. It posted a 15 percent increase in profits and expects renewable energy, mining, agriculture, tourism and hospitality-related sectors to remain healthy. But it says power cuts have severely affected operational costs in its factory outputs.
