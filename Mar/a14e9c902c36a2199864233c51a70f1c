AFP/Michael Bradley MURRAYFIELD - Ireland prop Tadhg Furlong will make his first appearance of this year's Six Nations after being named in the starting XV to face Scotland in Sunday's key clash at Murrayfield. Johnny Sexton, the Ireland captain, and centre Garry Ringrose, who both missed the round-three win in Italy, are also back in the side after recovering from injuries. Furlong's return to fitness following a calf problem is a welcome boost for Ireland coach Andy Farrell after back-up prop Finlay Bealham suffered a tournament-ending knee injury in a 34-20 victory in Rome last month. Ireland are the only team left in the tournament who can complete a Grand Slam. A win in Edinburgh would set them up for a March 18 tilt at a clean sweep against England in Dublin.
