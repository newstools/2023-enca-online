"We said to the senior executive team, no student who is participating in this protest must be suspended because we are exercising our right, we said to them, if NSFAS is paying R45000, no student must be asked to top up, we said to Wits management, scrap the top up even in external accommodation, there must be no top-up." "We said to Wits, in our internal accommodation, if accommodation is R80,000 and you're a student who is funded by NSFAS, that R80,000 must be paid, us as students were not paying anything more. Amandla!"
