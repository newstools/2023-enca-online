File: New Zealand's head coach Ian Foster. AFP/Franck Fife WELLINGTON - Questions surrounding the future of the All Blacks coaching staff will soon be answered. New Zealand Rugby has announced that it will appoint a new coach in the next four to six weeks. Current coach Ian Foster, who's faced criticism from day one, has confirmed his departure after this year's rugby world cup in France. READ: All Blacks coach Foster says won't reapply for job after World Cup Foster has had a tough time with the All Blacks and last year he oversaw three consecutive losses against Ireland and South Africa. He did bounce back though, clinching an eighth Rugby Championship and having a successful run on the end-of-year tour of Europe. But Foster might not be pleased with this announcement, having appealed to New Zealand Rugby bosses to delay it until after the World Cup. Crusaders coach Scott Robertson is the front-runner to replace Foster.
