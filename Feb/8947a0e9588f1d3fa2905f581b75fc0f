Five teams will be racing around the world vying for the crown of Ocean Race champions. They form part of the IMOCA fleet and have safely arrived in Cape Town to end the second leg. It is the 12th time the race has made its way to the Mother City. This stopover allows for a haul-out, which means the boats will be removed from the water for maintenance. The third leg will start on 26 February when they will make their way to Itajai in Brazil. * eNCA’s Justin Ford reports.
