Valencia have managed only one win in their previous matches in all competitions. In the debut of coach Ruben Baraja, Valencia suffered yet another defeat as Getafe moved to the 16th spot on the league table, thanks to three valuable points at home. Borja Mayoral netted the only goal for the night, his first since January, to snap Getafe’s seven-match winless streak in all competitions. The result sees Valencia remain in the drop zone, in 19th place with 20 points after 22 outings. The Che’s poor run started under coach Gennaro Gattuso before he was replaced by Baraja, who previously coached in the second division.
