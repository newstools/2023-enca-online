That’s if a growing Cross-Tri event held at Steyn City is anything to go by. Elite athletes are able to compete in South Africa while providing exposure for would-be athletes on the street. Local athletes turned out in their hundreds, braving sweltering conditions at this still-new triathlon event. Part of the eight-kilometre stretch of the scenic Steyn City has been used to stage the cross-triathlon. It's made up of a 600m swim, 30km bike ride and 7km run, with a half-course event offered as well. The Cross-Tri has attracted elite athletes, including Junior African champ Shaun Wolfaardt who defended last year’s title. * eNCA's Hloni Mtimkulu reports.
