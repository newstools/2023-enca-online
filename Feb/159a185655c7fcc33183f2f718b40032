AFP/Neil Hall JOHANNESBURG - The SA Tourism Board is launching a forensic investigation into who leaked the details of a shirt sleeve sponsorship deal with English soccer club, Tottenham Hotspur. The nearly R1-billion deal has drawn widespread condemnation after the information was leaked to the Daily Maverick. The country's tourism marketing agency says it was still in the process of consulting relevant stakeholders. It believes it was after the management's presentation to the Board that the plans were leaked. Three Board members resigned days after the story was reported, citing disagreements with the sponsorship plan. In addition, SA Tourism will also probe its interim Chief Financial Officer, Johan van der Walt's reported links to an agency billed to activate the Spur's sponsorship.
