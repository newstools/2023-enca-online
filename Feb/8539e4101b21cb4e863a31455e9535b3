Brown  JOHANNESBURG - Zakes Bantwini, Wouter Kellerman, and Nomcebo Zikode have done South Africa proud at the 65th annual Grammy Awards. The trio scooped Best Performance in the Global Music category. READ: Black Coffee wins first Grammy Award The award is for their hit song 'Bayethe'. Their win follows last year's Grammy won by DJ Black Coffee for the Best Dance/Electronic Album. This is Kellerman's fourth Grammy, while it's a first for both Bantwini and Zikode. Took me 17 years to find my path,
I have no words to express the emotions and grace that have come over me.
This moment is owed to my late Mother & Father.
I’m grateful
