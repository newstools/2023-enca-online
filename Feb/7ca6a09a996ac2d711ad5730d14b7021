Minister Enoch Godongwana will deliver the country's budget on Wednesday. In addition, the sugar industry says the tax has cost it thousands of jobs and billions in revenue. SA Cane-Growers CEO Andrew Russell says they have now approached Parliament to intervene.

"But that's taking time and in the meanwhile, we're struggling under the burden of this health promotion levy," he adds. Russell says they have asked for evidence that it has had a positive effect and none is forthcoming.
