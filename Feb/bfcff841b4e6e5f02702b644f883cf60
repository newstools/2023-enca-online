AFP JOHANNESBURG - Stage 6 rolling blackouts are now being implemented indefinitely. Eskom says this is due to unit breakdowns at the Arnot, Hendrina, Lethabo and Majuba power stations, as well as two units at Camden. READ: Stage 6 blackouts from 8pm Further, two generating units at the Lethabo station are not operating due to coal constraints. The New Vaal Mine has been unable to deliver the expected amount of coal in the past week because of the heavy rains. Breakdowns currently amount to more than 21 megawatts of generating capacity. #POWERALERT2
