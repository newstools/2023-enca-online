Alun Wyn Jones has won 156 caps for Wales.Â AFP/Christiaan Kotze LONDON - Scotland head into their match against Wales at Murrayfield on Saturday determined to avoid a repeat of the second-round stumbles that have so often proved costly to their Six Nations hopes. Gregor Townsend's men launched their campaign with a dramatic 29-23 win away to England last week as they recorded a third successive Calcutta Cup victory over their oldest rivals. Scotland, however, last posted wins in the opening two rounds of the tournament in 1996 -- when the Championship was still the Five Nations. They twice lost narrowly to Wales -- hammered 34-10 by Ireland in Cardiff last weekend -- on the second week in each of the past two years. Wales also have an excellent record in Edinburgh, having won on six of their past seven trips to Murrayfield. But while Scotland boss Townsend has recalled fit-again prop Zander Fagerson in the only change to his starting XV, Warren Gatland has five new players in his pack, as well as a positional switch, after a second stint as Wales coach started with the thumping defeat by Ireland. Scotland, after Duhan van der Merwe's brilliant solo try, found themselves eight points down in the second half against England before the wing capped a fine team move to cross the line again for his decisive second score six minutes from full-time. Gatland, never shy of putting pre-match pressure on his opponents, said: "I think it is the strongest Scottish side I have seen for a number of years in terms of the depth they have got." Townsend, meanwhile, was well aware of Scotland's need to build on their Twickenham triumph. "We have to improve from what we did last week because in large parts of that game, we weren't at our best," he said. "The good thing was we took our opportunities and we showed resilience into that final quarter and that makes us tough to beat. But we're not at our potential, and that's what we're striving towards."
