Luvuyo Memela of Richards Bay challenged by Sifiso Ngobeni of Mamelodi Sundowns during the 2023 Nedbank Cup match at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria. Samuel Shivambu/BackpagePix PRETORIA - Mamelodi Sundowns held their nerve to safely negotiate the Nedbank Cup's first hurdle. The defending champions saw off Richards Bay FC at Loftus. Sundowns went in front early but then conceded a debatable penalty. The spot kick was given despite the home side's protests. Nkanyiso Zungu powered in the penalty to level matters. Downs regained control of the game early in the second half withÂ Mosa Lubusa heading his side back into the lead. Peter Shalulile had opened the scoring and he claimed his second after the hour. That put the game beyond Richards Bay, 3 - 1 to Sundowns.
