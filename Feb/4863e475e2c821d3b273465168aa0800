Tottenham boss Antonio Conte is set for more time away from the club to recover from gallbladder surgery  LONDON - Tottenham manager Antonio Conte is set for another spell away from the touchline to recover from gallbladder surgery. The Italian has remained in his homeland after taking charge of Spurs' 1-0 defeat to AC Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday. Conte had returned to the bench for Saturday's 4-1 defeat at Leicester after undergoing surgery on February 1. "Following a routine post-operation check in Italy yesterday, Antonio Conte will remain at his family home to further and fully recover from his recent gallbladder surgery," a Tottenham statement said on Thursday. "Health is the most important consideration and everyone at the club wishes him well. Cristian Stellini will assume first-team responsibility." Assistant boss Stellini took charge of a 1-0 win over Manchester City earlier this month with Conte providing input from Italy. Spurs, who sit fifth in the Premier League, host West Ham in a London derby on Sunday.
