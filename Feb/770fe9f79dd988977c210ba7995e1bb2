JOHANNESBURG - What if you have just been released from prison and really have nowhere to go? What if you have no money and the key to the treasure you thought would save you is halfway across the country, in the arms of your enemy? Would you let it go, or would you do everything you possibly can to get it back? Nicolas ‘Nico’ Rapanyane (played by Thabo Malema) is an infamous has-been township criminal who has just been released from prison. He was framed by his then-close friend, Mindlos (Mpho Molepo). However, he hid gold bricks worth R8-million in a grave before he got locked up. When he gets home his sister is a drunk, their house is dilapidated. The graveyard where he buried the gold has changed and he forgot what he engraved on the tombstone. The key is his ex-girlfriend Neo, who is now in Durban with his nemesis, Mindlos – the biggest criminal in Durban. The world of the story is set in modern Johannesburg, Soweto, and later in Umhlanga, Durban. In Soweto, we explore the life of Nico’s life before his imprisonment and how he made a name for himself in the fast-paced street life of Soweto 10 years ago. Finding Neo and getting close to her is the only way to live the soft life he was used to. Will Neo make up with him now, after betraying him years ago? The comedy is full of twists and turns, long-lost romance and much more - delightful, easy viewing on your watchlist.
