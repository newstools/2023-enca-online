Shadrack Cezula is at the centre of a R24.9-million contract paid by the provincial Agriculture department to Gupta-linked company, Nulane Investment, back in 2011. Now, defence attorneys are asking why Cezula was granted indemnity and are questioning what the National Prosecuting Authority got out of the deal with him.
