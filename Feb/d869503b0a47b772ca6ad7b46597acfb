The Sunrisers batted first against the Joburg Super Kings in the second semi-final in Centurion. They lost Proteas limited overs captain Temba Bavuma for a duck inside the first over as he was caught by Reeza Hendricks off the bowling of Lizaad Williams. The Eastern Cape side soon slumped into 10 for the loss of two wickets before Aiden Markram recorded a century in 58 deliveries. At the end of their innings, they reached a massive score of 213 runs. The Super Kings suffered a hammer blow in their run chase with Sisanda Magala dismissing captain Faf du Plessis. Despite being under pressure for the better part of the game, Hendricks made a game of it as he was four runs short of a century. The Joburg Super Kings lost by 14 runs after registering 199 for six in 20 overs. The Eastern Cape Sunrisers will now take on favourites the Pretoria Capitals at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday.
