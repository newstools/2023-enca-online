#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Build One South Africa leader Mmusi Maimane says the Electoral Amendment Bill, does not care about the people and will be challenged in court. Maimane has accused Parliament of being tone-deaf and ignoring issues raised by South Africans. This follows the National Assembly's decision to pass the amendment bill, paving the way for independent candidates to stand in 2024's general elections. "Parliament is dominated by old political parties and those political parties are still seeking to protect their interests because they benefit from proportional representation systems," says Maimane. "We've been through an era of State Capture because of one party dominance, and I think secretly even parties in the opposition are hoping they can create that dominance so that they can benefit in the same way," he adds.
