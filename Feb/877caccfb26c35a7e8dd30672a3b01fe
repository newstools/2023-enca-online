AFP/Rodger Bosch PAARL - New Zealand will be firmly focused on the Momentum Proteas’ clash with Bangladesh on Tuesday. This is after the White Ferns boosted their semi-final hopes with a win over Sri Lanka. New Zealand won the toss and opted to take to the crease first in Paarl. They blitzed to 162/3 in 20 overs as Suzie Bates and Amelia Kerr proved menacing with the bat. Bates starred with 56 runs as Kerr hit an impressive 48-ball 66. In reply, the target of 163 for victory was too big an ask for Sri Lanka, who crumbled below the 100-run mark. Kerr and Lea Tahuhu took two wickets each as Sri Lanka managed only 60-all-out in just 15.5 overs, to lose by 102 runs. The New Zealand Women’s team will need a favour from Bangladesh to reach the semis when they play South Africa tomorrow, with the Proteas looking more likely to advance.
