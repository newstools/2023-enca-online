  CAPE TOWN - The family of AKA’s fiancé Anele Tembe is urging South Africans to stop suggesting they were involved in the rapper's killing. In a statement, Tembe’s father, Moses, says these allegations are untrue and lack substance.

Anele Tembe died in 2021 after falling from the 10th floor of a hotel in Cape Town. The National Prosecuting Authority took a decision not to prosecute in that case. Anele Tembe's father says the allegations seen on social media are cruel, libellous - and have caused emotional harm. AKA was murdered in Durban last Friday.
