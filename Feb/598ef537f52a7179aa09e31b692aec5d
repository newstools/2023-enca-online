South Africa is the country with the most Grammy wins in Africa JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's latest Grammy win provided a ray of light for the crisis-plagued country Monday, with the president hailing the victorious musical trio for putting the nation back "on the world stage". Popular DJ-producer Zakes Bantwini, flautist Wouter Kellerman and songstress Nomcebo Zikode won the best global music performance award for their Zulu song 'Bayethe' at a Sunday ceremony in Los Angeles. "We applaud you for your brilliant contribution in placing South Africa on the world stage once again," Ramaphosa wrote on Twitter. 'Bayethe', which means 'hail' in the local Zulu language, combines traditional African beats, Zulu lyrics and the flute. The victory provided a brief distraction for South Africans who are otherwise facing record power cuts, high unemployment and rampant crime. South Africa's arts and culture ministry applauded the group in a statement, saying the country was "proud of the great work" they produced "without compromising national identity". A continental powerhouse in the music arena, South Africa already boasted numerous Grammy winners, including famous male acapella groups Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Soweto Gospel Choir, and singer Miriam Makeba. The EFF tweeted that the latest victory reaffirmed "the depth in talent" in the country's music industry, "which is globally recognised and appreciated". The award ceremony was hosted by comedian Trevor Noah, who is also from South Africa. "Thank you for taking our culture and heritage to the world and for inspiring us that 'our dreams are valid'," the ANC party wrote in a statement.
