File: A water tap. AFP/Martin Bernetti  JOHANNESBURG -Â The total power supply failure experienced at Rand Water's Mapleton Booster Station on Wednesday could lead to water shortages. The booster station is supplied by the Ekurhuleni substation, fed from the Eskom grid. READ:Â Tshwane blames Rand Water for water shortage According to a Rand Water statement, Eskom technicians are busy with fault-finding, and the restoration time is unknown. The incident has resulted in a decline of Rand Water's reservoirs affecting the cities of Tshwane, Ekurhuleni, Govan Mbeki, Lesedi and Thembisile Hani local municipalities. Should the restoration of power take much longer, this may result in low levels that could lead to water shortages in parts of these cities. Rand Water is urging all consumers to use water sparingly.  ðŸš¨MEDIA STATEMENTðŸš¨
