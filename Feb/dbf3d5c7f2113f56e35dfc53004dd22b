Spain forward Esther Gonzalez scored twice against the Czech Republic in Australia NEWCASTLE - Real Madrid's Esther Gonzalez scored twice as Spain beat the Czech Republic 3-0 on Wednesday to get their Women's World Cup preparations back on track. Gonzalez's Real team-mate Athenea del Castillo converted a penalty to seal the win, despite Spain missing 15 top players who are embroiled in a row with coach Jorge Vilda. Spain end the four-team Cup of Nations -- a dress rehearsal for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July-August -- with two wins from three. The Euro 2022 quarter-finalists beat Jamaica 3-0 but lost 3-2 to hosts Australia. The unbeaten Australians round out the tournament against Jamaica later Wednesday needing a draw to win the trophy. Spain applied all the early pressure in the rain at Newcastle, north of Sydney, with the breakthrough coming on 28 minutes after a neat series of passes ended with Gonzalez tapping in from close range. The experienced striker doubled the lead 10 minutes later with a header, before Del Castillo made it 3-0 from the penalty spot with six minutes left. Spain have two more international windows left to tune up for the World Cup and for the 15 players, including a large Barcelona cohort, to decide whether they want to play under Vilda again. None have featured since September when they made themselves unavailable for selection, reportedly unhappy at the locker-room atmosphere and his training methods. The Spanish FA backed the coach. mp/ryj/pst
