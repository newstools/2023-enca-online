Courtesy of #DStv403 TSHWANE - Cilliers Brink has been selected as the Democratic Alliance and Multi-Party Coalition's candidate for the position of Tshwane Executive Mayor. Randall Williams resigned following adverse findings by the auditor-general’s office. Brink says rectifying these findings will be high on his list of priorities if elected. READ: Tshwane council | Capital city without a mayor - for now Brink said, "we have to firstly focus with laser-like power on getting control on the finances of the city and responding to the negative findings of the AG. The DA as well as our multiparty coalition partners regard the findings as very serious." "It is indicative of a breakdown of controls, we now need to restore that and we need to have a clean out where a clean out is necessary but it's also very important that we focus on the service delivery aspects of the agenda, reduce the number of unscheduled power outages as well as the effect that load-shedding has on basic services, not just the state of the electricity network, but also sanitation, water and so forth and of course we have to look at the job of the Tshwane metro police in securing service infrastructure and making sure that Tshwane's workforce is productive, that they deliver value for ratepayers money." "So I think a laser-like focus on that agenda but also a willingness to cooperate with our coalition partners. I will be meeting them tomorrow morning, the leaders of the local coalition partners to also get their input and I'll certainly take their suggestions and comments on board."
