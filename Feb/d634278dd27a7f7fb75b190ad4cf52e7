Randburg resident Dave Winston said, "from my experience, in what’s been going on just in our street in Randburg, I have my doubts that these things are actually going to come to fruition.” Cosatu Gauteng chair Amos Monyela said, "we don’t think this is enough, we still need more. You need an Eskom that is working so that is working so that this can work hand in hand with Eskom. You need more than the 800 megawatts that they want to put in” Joburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Bernadette Zeiler said, "we require a larger amount, and also many businesses have had to close down due to the energy crisis, especially smaller businesses in the manufacturing sector as well, because they weren’t able to invest in alternative energy. We’re looking at a minimum of 4 to 5 billion rand to assist businesses.” Monyela said, "I’m not too sure if we have resources. We’ve heard him saying R1.2 billion, we are thinking that he’s speaking from experience. He’s also looking for money for e-Tolls so we’ll see when the MEC of finance is presenting his budget if the money is there. Because there’s this tendency that the premier or president will announce, and then we get to Treasury, there’s no funding for these things.”
