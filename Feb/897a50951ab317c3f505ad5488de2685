AFP/Gianluigi Guercia JOHANNESBURG - Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says the state is looking to hold contractors responsible for services rendered to power stations. Gordhan says they will now be monitoring service providers and making sure they deliver on their mandate. This is in a bid to fix the country’s energy crisis. "There is a business model if you'd like, or operational model at the power stations," he says.

"Not all the contractors are delivering what they are supposed to deliver when they undertake maintenance," he says. According to Gordhan, this is something the board is looking at and something they want to understand.
