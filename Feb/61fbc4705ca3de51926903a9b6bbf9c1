A list of new members has allegedly been sent to government for consideration as the current board's tenure comes to an end. Longest-serving board chair Judge Jerome Ngwenya's name does not make it onto the apparent new list. WATCH: Ingonyama Trust denies owing eThekwini municipality Ngwenya has been chairperson since 2000. Some reports suggest businessman Jacob Mnisi is touted as the new chair. AmaZulu Traditional Prime Minister, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, says King MisuZulu KaZwelithini -- as sole custodian -- is also in the dark about this matter.

"Nor have I heard from Minister Didiza about new membership of the Ingonyama trust board and any new membership." Buthelezi says the matter must be handled with sensitivity as it will create a lot of problems within the Zulu nation itself, which will end in a conflict they don't need.
