File: Former president Jacob Zuma looks on during a press conference. JOHANNESBURG -Â Jacob Zuma's private prosecution of Advocate Billy Downer and journalist Karyn Maughan has been postponed to August. Zuma charges that Maughan and Downer leaked and published confidential medical records, contravening the National Prosecuting Authority Act. Downer has launched his own application to have the private prosecution declared an abuse of court processes. This is the latest in a string of bids by Zuma to stall his corruption case linked to the 1999 arms deal. Zuma and French company Thales are accused of corruption, racketeering, and money laundering.
