The Hindu festival of Thaipusam commemorates the day when goddess Pavarthi gave her son Lord Muruga an invincible lance with which he destroyed evil demons.Â AFP/Mohd Rasfan KUALA LUMPUR - Ethnic Indian Malaysians massed in Hindu temples across the country on Sunday to celebrate the annual Thaipusam festival, months after the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions that had barred large crowds. Tens of thousands of people gathered at the Batu Caves temple just outside Kuala Lumpur over the weekend, many piercing their bodies with hooks and skewers in an act of devotion to the deity Lord Murugan. The event commemorates the day when the goddess Parvathi gave her son Lord Murugan a powerful lance to fight evil demons. Hindu devotees climb the 272 steps to the Batu Caves temple to make offerings during the Thaipusam festival Bearing offerings such as milk pots and heavy ornate metal structures called kavadis, devotees walked barefoot up 272 steps to reach the temple -- an important religious site for local Hindus. This year's celebration was the liveliest seen in recent years, with devotees glad at being allowed to return to observe their rituals. Some devotees appeared to be in a state of trance as they carried the kavadis, which can weigh as much as 100 kilograms. Others pierced their bodies with skewers or hung multiple hooks and chains from their bodies in an act of penance. Prior to Thaipusam, devotees will typically hold daily prayer sessions, abstain from sex and stick to a strict vegetarian diet for weeks.
