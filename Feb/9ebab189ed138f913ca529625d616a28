Bobi, a 30 year-old Portuguese dog that has been declared the world's oldest dog by Guinness World Records, walking in the surroundings of his home in the village of Conqueiros near Leiria. AFP/Patricia De Melo Moreira LISBON - A dog from Portugal is not only a good boy, but he's now been recognised as the oldest good boy in the world. Guinness World Records has crowned him the most elderly pooch in history. The brown-haired dog lives near Leiria in central Portugal, surrounded by cats. He's a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of livestock guardian dog. They have an average life expectancy of 12-14 years, but Bobi's wagged his tail to 30 years and 266 days. His owners, the Costas, credit his long lifespan to a peaceful environment and roaming freely on their farm.
