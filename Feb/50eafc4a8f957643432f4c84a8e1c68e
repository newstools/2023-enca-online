JOHANNESBURG - SA Tourism has defended its proposed sponsorship of English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur.
This decision has been met with widespread anger from South Africans, who say there are better things to spend the money on.
Acting CEO Themba Khumalo says SA Tourism hasn’t signed a contract yet, but intends to.
