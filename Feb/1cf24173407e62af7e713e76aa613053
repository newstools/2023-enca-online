He says instead of doing a tell-all interview on alleged shenanigans at the ailing power utility, De Ruyter should have approached law enforcement authorities.

But our appeal as the BBC is that we should not be giving him the attention he is seeking because we are wasting our time focusing on someone who is the past," Matabane said. Matabane also has doubts about Calib Cassim's appointment as interim Eskom CEO.
