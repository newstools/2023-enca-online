We want to take advantage of this situation to introduce new, very difficult-to-copy and tamper-proof number plates so that those that are using wrong or duplicate number plates will have no time to drive through our roads in Gauteng," Lesufi said. "As we speak, we have issued the Government Gazette on 17 February 2023 for consultation and comments on new security features. This new system will also assist in managing the abuse of temporary number plates. "We also call upon SADC countries to create a new database of all vehicles within the region so that we can have a common verification database of all cars that are coming in and out of our country," Lesufi said.
