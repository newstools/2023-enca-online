This became apparent at the swearing-in of new ANC Members of Parliament. The party’s Deputy President Paul Mashatile is among those who took the oath in the National Assembly but he’s remaining coy about whether he’ll be appointed as the country’s second in command. Maropene Ramakgopa, Sihle Zikalala and Parks Tau joined Mashatile at the swearing-in ceremony. eNCA's Ayesha Ismail reports in the video above.
