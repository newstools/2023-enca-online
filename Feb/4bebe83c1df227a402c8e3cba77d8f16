AFP/Rodger Bosch CAPE TOWN - The Pakistan women's team will be looking for a strong finish in their final Group 1 match. This after their slim hopes of reaching the semi-finals were wiped out by India’s win over Ireland. Pakistan take on the England women at Newlands in Cape Town in their final stretch of the group stage. India will be keeping a keen eye on the fixture, hoping Pakistan will pull off a surprise victory to seal the top spot. However, it will not be an easy feat for Pakistan, who have so far managed just one win. That was over Ireland by 70 runs. They face a formidable side in England, who have won all three of their fixtures and don’t seem likely to relinquish the top spot in Group 2.
