The side from the capital are through to the final after seeing off Paarl Royals by 29 runs in the semi-final at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Paarl Royals won the toss and chose to field first as they looked to turn the tables on their opponents who had beaten them barely 24 hours earlier. After losing the wicket of in-form Kusel Mendis early on, Rilee Rossouw scored a half-century. His runs came in handy as the Capitals managed 153 runs in their 20 overs. However, JP Duminy's men never got going in their run chase as they failed to form solid partnerships, losing cheap wickets throughout their innings. They were bowled out for 124 runs with six balls remaining and in the process slumped to a 29 runs defeat. The Pretoria Capitals will now take on either the Joburg Super Kings or the Sunrisers Eastern Cape, who are contesting the second semi-final on Thursday night.
