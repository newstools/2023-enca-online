Finn Russell joined Racing 92 in 2018.Â AFP/Adrian Dennis PARIS - Scotland head to Six Nations champions France on Sunday with Les Bleus head coach Fabien Galthie planning to see two magnificent fly-halves Finn Russell and Romain Ntamack on show. The visitors' Russell has helped his side to an unprecedented two opening wins in the Six Nations, against England and Wales, with three try assists. Ntamack was impressive in the victory against Italy but failed to hit his straps in the loss at world number one side Ireland two weeks ago. "There is going to be two magnificent players facing each other," Galthie told reporters on Thursday. "Sunday we'll see the best in rugby. "A sold-out stadium, music, the sound, pyrotechnics, we're not going to be bored at the Stade France. "It will be a spectacle," he added. Galthie has been forced into starting tight-head prop Mohamed Haouas with Uini Atonio suspended and 2021 World Rugby player of the year Antoine Dupont will captain the side at scrum-half. Dupont may have looked off-form but Galthie's men still lead the competition for off-loads and tackles broken. "They've got some of the best players in the world and the biggest depth of any nation currently," said Townsend, who played for Castres and Montpellier during his career. "They play a game where their defence and set piece are massive but there's a real intent to play when they do get the ball - sometimes off counter-attack, sometimes turnover ball. "We're going to have to be at our best to get a win this weekend."
