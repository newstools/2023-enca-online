In a statement, the provincial education department says a grade 10 pupil from Dinokaneng Secondary School in Sebokeng was stabbed by a fellow pupil last Thursday. The incident is alleged to have occurred outside the premises after school hours. The boy was rushed to Sebokeng Hospital, where he was certified dead on arrival. A grade 11 pupil from the same school was stabbed on Wednesday. The department says it believes the incidents are linked to rampant gangsterism in the area.
