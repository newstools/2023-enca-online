The latest incident to shock the nation is the brutal death of Tshwane University of Technology third-year student Ntokozo Xaba. Xaba was allegedly stabbed to death at a residence earlier this month by her ex-boyfriend. Students at this campus say women aren't safe. TUT Vice-Chancelor Tinyiko Maluleke says there are already programs in place to fight Gender-based violence but admits more work needs to be done. "So there are other issues we need to look at beyond policing and physical security...beyond the issues of whether you have cameras, security gates, security guards or not." Some gender-based violence activist groups say accountability is needed. They wonder what happened to the promised R1.6 billion plan to combat gender-based violence. Not In My Name's Themba Masango said, "we're hoping that the President will actually come with a clear a decisive action towards gender based violence....they'll be clarity with regards to what happened to that money, what it was used for." The SRC from the institution say it'll now be taking action, ensuring that off-campuses residences accredited to the university have safety measures in place to protect students. Meanwhile, Higher Education minister, Blade Nzimande has vowed to launch a gender-based violence awareness programme, following  Xaba's murder. A move the students hope will ensure their safety in society.
