Tshwane speaker Murunwa Makwerela is unfazed by the proposed motion of no confidence against him, said to be planned by some coalition members. They say he's badly handled the resignation process of former mayor Randall Williams. eNCA's Pule Letshwiti-Jones is on that story. #DStv403 TSHWANE - The Tshwane Council is running out of time to elect a new mayor. Randal Williams's about-turn on his final day helming the City and the council's handling of the matter has been met with criticism. Council speaker Dr Murunwa Makwarela sought legal opinion on which of two separate resignation letters it would accept. READ: Randall Williams resigns as Tshwane mayor Finally, it's been decided that the initial letter, that announced his immediate resignation on 13 February, will be used. This puts the council on the back foot in replacing Williams sooner - rather than later. City of Tshwane speaker Dr Murunwa Makwarela says a new mayor must be appointed soon or the metro risks being plunged into political limbo. Tshwane Mayor Randal Williams initially resigned with immediate effect on the 13th of February but made a u-turn just hours later, saying he’d instead end his term at the end of the month. After seeking a legal opinion on the matter, Makwarela was told that Williams’s first resignation notice should be the one considered and not the second that extended his notice period. The ANC has joined the fray, accusing officials of wasting residents’ time by dragging their heels. It says a new mayor must be elected soon to pass an adjustment budget that speaks to service delivery. Makwarela says a special council meeting is expected to be convened soon to elect a new mayor to helm the City.
