 JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has been added to the Financial Action Task Force's list of greylisted countries. SA is on the list of nations that have failed to adequately put in place measures toÂ tackle illicit financial outflows. The greylisting is likely to put a massive dent in South Africa's GDP. WATCH | Minister Godongwana's 2023 budget speech The Financial Action Task Force found that South Africa was partially compliant or non-compliant, with 20 of its 40 recommendations. The global watchdog says SA has agreed to work with the organisation to address any identified deficiencies. During his Budget Speech Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana warned the country, to prepare for the possibility that it could be greylisted.
