Ron Gaunt/Sportzpics/SA20/BackpagePix CENTURION - The Paarl Royals secured their passage to the semi-finals of the SA20 League despite suffering defeat in the final round-robin match. JP Duminy's charges fielded first at SuperSport Park in Centurion against table-topping Pretoria Capitals. The home side had a solid start thanks to the opening partnership of Phil Salt and Kusal Mendis before the former was caught by Jos Buttler off the bowling of Lungi Ngidi. With Salt gone, Mendis went on to record a solid 80 from 41 deliveries before he was also dismissed by the Proteas' fast bowler. The Pretoria Capitals went on to register a competitive 226 for the loss of five wickets after 20 overs. The Paarl Royals' run chase was characterised by losing wickets in regular intervals including that of Eoin Morgan. However, Jos Buttler ensured that the Paarl Royals get closer to 163 runs required in order to have a better run rate than the Durban Super Giants in the fourth spot. In the end, the visitors managed 167 runs in 20 overs, losing by 59 runs but sealed a semi-final spot in the process.
