AFP/Yasuyoshi Chiba NAIROBI -Â Kenya's revenue from its vital tourism industry surged to more than $2-billion last year but remains below pre-pandemic levels, the government said. International tourist arrivals jumped by more than 70 percent to 1.48 million as travel rebounded following the Covid-19 outbreak, while revenue shot up 83 percent to 268 billion Kenyan shillings ($2.12-billion). The United States was the biggest market, with 16 percent of arrivals, followed by Uganda, the United Kingdom and Tanzania, Tourism Minister Peninah Malonza said at a press conference. "The arrivals represent a 72.4 percent recovery towards 2019 numbers, which is above the global average recovery rate of 63 percent," Malonza said. Kenya is renowned for its stunning Indian Ocean beaches and wildlife parks that are home to the so-called Big Five -- lions, elephants, rhinos, leopards and buffalo -- as well as giraffes, hippos and cheetahs. The government said in May last year that tourism earnings made up almost 10 percent of Kenya's gross domestic product before Covid devastated international travel.
