The 45,000-kilometre under-sea fibre optic cable will be laid across the continent's entire shoreline. The two-Africa cable will speed up internet and cloud services between Africa and the rest of the world. The fibre optic cable has more capacity in terms of bandwidth, which means in time you will have access to faster internet when you are online, and a more reliable connection while you browse. The open access system provides unregulated internet access to any company that wants to become your cloud provider. The project is expected to be operational on the East Coast by the end of the year. * eNCAâ€™s Nqobile Madlala reports.
