Automobile Association's Layton Beard spoke to #eNCA. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Fuel prices will be going up at midnight on Tuesday. Motorists will be paying more for all grades of petrol and diesel. WATCH:Â Petrol and Diesel prices set to rise Both 93 and 95 unleaded petrol will cost R1.27 a litre more. The price of diesel will go up by between 30 and 31 cents a litre, while illuminating paraffin will cost 13 cents more. While the price of Brent crude remained below 85 dollars a barrel, the weaker rand has raised the cost of importing fuel. The rand has taken a knock over the last month as uncertainty around the power crisis intensifies. The latest shock to the currency has been the country's greylisting. #eNCA speaks to consumer debt expert, Moeshfieka Botha. #DStv403
