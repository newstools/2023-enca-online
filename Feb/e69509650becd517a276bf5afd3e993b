Bangladesh's Nigar Sultana made a brave 30 CAPE TOWN - South Africa were set a target of 114 to reach the Women’s T20 World Cup semi-finals after restricting Bangladesh to 113 for six at Newlands in Cape Town on Tuesday. South Africa need a win to tie with New Zealand and Sri Lanka on points – and climb above their rivals on net run rate. It was a less than imposing performance by the host nation against a team that had lost all three of their previous matches. No batter was able to score more than captain Nigar Sultana’s 30 but aggressive running between the wickets enabled Bangladesh to keep the score moving, aided by some nervy errors in the field by South Africa. Seam bowlers Marizanne Kapp and Ayabonga Khaka took two wickets each. Australia have already won Group One and will meet India in the semi-finals on Thursday, while South Africa or New Zealand will play against England, who clinched top place in Group Two earlier on Tuesday, in the second semi-final on Friday. Brief scores: Bangladesh 113-6 in 20 overs (Nigar Sultana 30; M. Kapp 2-17, A. Khaka 2-21). Toss: Bangladesh. Match situation: South Africa need 114 runs to win.
