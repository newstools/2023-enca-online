File: Energy regulator Nersa. JOHANNESBURG - Energy regulator, Nersa, is seeking public comment, on the country’s emergency electricity plan. READ: SA's electricity crisis | Eskom wants clarity on Nersa calculations This follows a draft proposal from the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, that will allow Eskom to procure energy from various sources. These include buying power from within South Africa, and neighbouring countries. Eskom is also planning to approach National Treasury, for an exemption from procurement related provisions. This means Eskom does not have to follow normal tender procedures. Nersa says it hasn’t decided on the request, but processes are already in place once public comment is received. The public has until the 15th of March, to comment.
