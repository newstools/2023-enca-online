Royal AM goalkeeper Hugo Nyame. Samuel Shivambu/BackpagePix CAPE TOWN - AmaZulu, TS Galaxy and lower division Casric Stars are all through to the Nedbank Cup last 16. Royal AM also advanced after defeating Cape Town City on penalties in the Mother City. The match ended goalless after 120 minutes so it had to be decided by a shoot-out. Royal AM goalkeeper Hugo Nyame was the hero of the hour, saving two spot kicks. The KZN outfit were able to convert all four kicks they took and that was decisive. Shot-stopper Nyame, who survived a serious health scare late last year, proved his worth as his saves knocked Cape Town City out 4-3 on penalties. So it's Royal AM who will be in the last 16 draw.
