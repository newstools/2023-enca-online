#eNCA Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - City Power will be withdrawing its employees and contractors from Westbury, Eldorado Park, Claremont, Riverlea and surrounding areas due to concerns for their safety. The recent murder of an alleged gang leader has left these areas as No-Go areas and has forced the service provider to act in the interest of the safety of employees. City Power is in talks with councillors to come up with contingency measures to ensure customers are not left stranded without electricity for prolonged periods.
