#DStv403 JOHANNESBURG -Â Eskom updates the country on the status of rolling blackouts. The beleaguered power utility has been alternating between stage five and six power cuts since Tuesday. That's after multiple breakdowns at various power stations. Stage five is currently underway. Eskom has been struggling to keep the lights on, implementing blackouts every day since January. Last year saw a historic number of days lost to power cuts with experts warning 2023 could very well eclipse that record.
